    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="../images/bolognesee.jpeg" alt="bolognese">
   <section> <p>This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. </p>
    <p>She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when </p>
    <p>most Americans thought 'Bolognese' was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, </p>
    <p>Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. </p>
   <p> I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan</p>
  <p> cheese and a sprinkle of parsley. </p></section>

  <section><h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><p>Step 1</p>
        <p>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat;
        <p> cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent,</p>
            <p>about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly</p>
          <p>  until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</p>
           <p> Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, </p>
            <p> cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>Step 2</p>
          <p>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring </p>
          <p>often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still </p>
          <p>slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>Step 3</p>
          <p>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; </p>
          <p>cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more</p>
          <p>minutes.</p>
          
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>Step 4</p>
          <p>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your </p>
          <p>fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into </p>
          <p>sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>Step 5</p>
          <p>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down</p>
          <p>into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from </p>
          <p>top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a </p>
          <p>little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</p>
